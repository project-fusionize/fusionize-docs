# Fusionize Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the official **Fusionize** documentation website.

The site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 18.0 or above recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

### Local Development

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

Build the static website for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The static artifacts will be generated in the `build/` directory.
